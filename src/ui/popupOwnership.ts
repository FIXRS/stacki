// Which popup a press belongs to.

// A popup that opens from inside another one — the variable picker from a field in
// the spacing editor, the colour picker from a swatch in a shadow layer — is drawn
// through a portal, so it lands at the end of <body> rather than inside the popover
// it came from. Every "did that press land outside me?" check is a `contains()`, and
// by the DOM's reckoning the answer for a portalled child is yes. So pressing the
// dot closed the editor the dot lives in, and pressing HEX closed the layer whose
// colour was being picked — each of them taking its own child down with it.
//
// A popup registers itself here with the element it was opened FROM. That is the
// missing link: the picker's anchor sits inside the popover, so a press inside the
// picker is a press inside the popover, however far apart the two are in the DOM.
